- ‚úÖ **Metadata Cleanup**: Robust egg effect removal system using metadata tagging
- ‚úÖ **Debug Button Suite**: 5 debug buttons for comprehensive testing
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive console output for all visual systems

### Debug Testing Capabilities
**New Debug Buttons Available**:
1. **"DEBUG: Test Egg Effect"** - Instant egg splat + visual overlay
2. **"DEBUG: Test Chat Growth"** - Direct 4x chat panel growth
3. **"DEBUG: Simulate Hand Complete"** - Test existing game flow
4. **"DEBUG: Shrink Chat"** - Return chat to normal size
5. **"DEBUG: Clean Egg Effects"** - Remove all visual effects from screen

## Build/Test/Lint Commands
- **Build**: `godot --headless --build-solutions --quit`
- **Run**: `godot --` (automatically builds first)
- **Debug**: Use VS Code debug configurations (Launch Godot, Launch Scene, Attach)
- **Export**: `godot --headless --export-release "macOS"`
- **Open Editor**: `godot`

## Quick Start - Testing Multiplayer
1. **Launch first instance**: Run `godot --` (becomes host automatically)
2. **Launch second instance**: Run `godot --` in new terminal (becomes client)
3. **First instance**: Click "Host Game" button in main menu
4. **Second instance**: Click "Join Game" button in main menu
5. **Both instances should connect and start card game with synchronized timers**

## Architecture & Structure
- **Godot 4.4.1** game project with **C# .NET 8.0** support
- **Main directories**: `scripts/` (C# code), `scenes/` (Godot scenes), `.godot/` (build artifacts)
- **Assembly name**: SoreLosers
- **Environment**: DOTNET_ROOT="/opt/homebrew/opt/dotnet/libexec"
- **Rendering**: Mobile renderer optimized

## üõ†Ô∏è Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. ENet Host Creation Error Resolution
**Problem**: `Couldn't create an ENet host. Parameter "host" is null.`
**Root Cause**: Improper ENet multiplayer peer initialization timing
**Files Changed**: 
- `scripts/NetworkManager.cs`
- `scripts/GameManager.cs`

**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced ENet initialization with proper error handling in `StartHosting()`
- Added try-catch blocks around server creation with detailed logging
- Simplified server creation parameters: `peer.CreateServer(port, MaxClients, 0, 0, 0)`
- Removed problematic async/await pattern that was causing timing issues
- Added fresh peer creation for each port attempt to avoid state corruption

### 2. Auto-Hosting Bypass Fix  
**Problem**: Both instances automatically became hosts, bypassing main menu UI
**Root Cause**: Debug networking setup running automatically in `_Ready()`
**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/GameManager.cs`

**Changes Made**:
- Removed automatic `SetupDebugNetworking()` call from `_Ready()`
- Users now manually control host/join through UI buttons
- Both instances start properly at main menu
- Added comments explaining the change to prevent regression

### 3. Timer Synchronization Implementation
**Problem**: Turn timers didn't match between host and client instances
**Root Cause**: Only host was running timer, clients had no sync mechanism
**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/CardManager.cs`
- `scripts/CardGameUI.cs`

**Changes Made**:
- Added `TurnTimerUpdated` signal to CardManager
- Implemented `NetworkTimerUpdate` RPC method for host‚Üíclient timer sync
- Added `_Process()` method in CardManager to broadcast timer updates every frame
- Modified `GetGameState()` to return synchronized timer for clients
- Connected timer update signal in CardGameUI for real-time display
- Added `networkTurnTimeRemaining` field for client-side timer tracking

### 4. Game Visibility Enhancement
**Problem**: Players could only see their own cards, no visibility into game state
**Root Cause**: UI only displayed local player's hand, no shared game information
**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/CardGameUI.cs`

**Changes Made**:
- Added `playersInfoContainer` and `playerInfoLabels` UI elements
- Implemented `CreatePlayersInfoPanel()` to show all players' status
- Added `UpdatePlayersInfo()` to display card counts, scores, and turn indicators
- Implemented `UpdateTrickDisplay()` to show cards played in current trick
- Enhanced `_Process()` to update trick and player info continuously
- Added visual turn indicators (yellow highlighting for current player)

### 5. Player Management Improvements
**Problem**: "Player ID already exists" errors and duplicate player handling
**Root Cause**: Player ID assignment conflicts and poor error messaging
**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/GameManager.cs`
- `scripts/NetworkManager.cs`

**Changes Made**:
- Modified `AddPlayer()` to only emit `PlayerJoined` signal for new players
- Changed error level from `PrintErr` to `Print` for duplicate player updates
- Added safety checks in NetworkManager for player ID updates
- Only re-add players when network ID actually changes
- Enhanced logging to show when player IDs are updated vs. when they're unchanged

### 6. Concurrent Gameplay Implementation ‚ú® NEW DESIGN
**Problem**: Sequential phases prevented strategic gameplay between card game and sabotage
**Root Cause**: Original design had distinct CardPhase ‚Üí RealTimePhase transitions
**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/GameManager.cs` - Added player location tracking (AtTable vs InKitchen)
- `scripts/CardManager.cs` - Card play validation for table presence
- `scripts/CardGameUI.cs` - Leave/Return Table buttons and view switching
- `scenes/CardGame.tscn` - Integrated kitchen view alongside card table

**NEW DESIGN**: Players can now leave the table anytime to gather sabotage items while the card game continues. This creates strategic tension between participating in the card game vs. gathering eggs/stink bombs.

**Changes Made**:
- Added `PlayerLocation` enum (AtTable, InKitchen) to GameManager
- Added Leave Table / Return to Table buttons always available during card game
- Card plays only allowed when player is AtTable
- Turn timer handles absent players (they miss their turn)
- Integrated Player movement system into CardGame scene
- View switching between card table and kitchen based on player location
- Location tracking with events for multiplayer synchronization

## Current Working Features ‚úÖ

### Networking
- **Host-Client Architecture**: First instance hosts, second connects automatically
- **ENet Multiplayer**: Reliable connection with 6-digit room codes
- **RPC Synchronization**: Card plays, game state, and timer sync
- **Automatic Instance Detection**: Uses host lock files for clean separation

### Concurrent Gameplay ‚ú® NEW
- **Leave/Return Table**: Players can leave the card table anytime via buttons
- **Continuous Card Game**: Card game continues regardless of who's at/away from table
- **Strategic Decisions**: Balance between playing cards vs. gathering sabotage items
- **Location Tracking**: System tracks whether players are AtTable or InKitchen
- **Turn Handling**: Players miss their turn if away from table when timer expires
- **View Switching**: Seamless transition between card table and kitchen views

### Card Game
- **Trick-Taking Logic**: Standard 52-card deck with proper rules
- **Turn Management**: Host-authoritative with client synchronization
- **Timer System**: 10-second turns with synchronized countdowns
- **AI Players**: Automatic AI opponents fill empty slots
- **Deterministic Shuffling**: Fixed seed ensures same deck across instances
- **Table Presence Validation**: Cards can only be played when at table

### Movement & Sabotage
- **Player Movement**: Arrow key movement in kitchen area
- **Item Interaction**: Egg collection, sink washing, stink bomb pickup
- **Sabotage Framework**: Complete egg throwing and stink bomb systems
- **Real-time Actions**: Sabotage actions work concurrent with card game
- **Inventory System**: Track eggs and stink bombs during movement

### UI & Display
- **Player Hand**: Shows local player's cards with play validation
- **Players Info Panel**: Shows all players' names, card counts, scores
- **Current Trick Display**: Shows cards played by all players this round
- **Turn Indicators**: Highlights current player in yellow
- **Real-time Updates**: All UI elements update immediately across instances
- **Location Status**: Shows whether player is at table or in kitchen
- **Dynamic Views**: Card table and kitchen views switch based on location

## Network Architecture

```
Host Instance (First to Start)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Creates ENet Server (Port 7777)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Manages Game State (Authoritative)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Controls Timer & Turn Logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Broadcasts Updates to Clients
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Handles AI Player Actions

Client Instance (Second to Start)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Connects to Host via ENet
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Receives Game State Updates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sends Card Plays to Host
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Displays Synchronized UI
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Waits for Host Commands
```

## System Components

### Core Managers (Autoloads)
- **GameManager**: Central coordinator, phase management, player tracking
- **NetworkManager**: ENet multiplayer, host/client logic, RPC routing  
- **CardManager**: Game logic, deck management, trick-taking rules
- **UIManager**: Interface coordination (placeholder)
- **SabotageManager**: Real-time mechanics (placeholder)

### Key Scripts
- **CardGameUI.cs**: Main game interface with hand display and game info
- **MainMenuUI.cs**: Host/Join buttons and room code input
- **LobbyUI.cs**: Player list and game start interface

## Code Style & Conventions
- **C# Classes**: PascalCase, inherit from Godot nodes
- **Public fields**: PascalCase with `[Export]` attribute for inspector exposure
- **Private fields**: camelCase
- **Methods**: PascalCase, override Godot methods with `_` prefix (`_Ready()`, `_Process()`)
- **Imports**: `using Godot;` first, then standard libraries
- **Comments**: Extensive logging for debugging multiplayer issues

## Debugging Tips

### Network Issues
- Check console for "NetworkManager:" logs showing host/client status
- Look for "CardManager:" logs showing game state changes
- "GameManager:" logs show phase transitions and player management

### Common Error Patterns
- **"Player ID X already exists"**: Normal info message, not an error (fixed)
- **"ENet host creation failed"**: Check if port 7777 is available
- **"Method not found"**: Usually RPC method name mismatch

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Both instances start at main menu (not auto-hosting)
- [ ] Host can create game with room code display
- [ ] Client can join and see "Connected" status
- [ ] Timer countdowns match on both instances
- [ ] Card plays appear on both instances immediately
- [ ] Players info panel shows all players correctly
- [ ] Turn indicators match between instances

## Known Working Features
- ‚úÖ Multiplayer connection and synchronization
- ‚úÖ Turn-based card game with proper rules
- ‚úÖ Synchronized timers and game state
- ‚úÖ Real-time card play visibility
- ‚úÖ Player management and AI opponents
- ‚úÖ Host-authoritative game control

## Still TODO (Future Development)

## Emergency Debugging
If networking breaks again:
1. Check console for ENet errors - usually port conflicts
2. Verify GameManager singleton is working - look for "Singleton instance created"
3. Check host detection - should see "Host lock file" messages
4. Look for RPC errors - usually method name mismatches
5. Restart both instances if state gets corrupted
