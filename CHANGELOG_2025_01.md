## 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes

### **Instance Detection Race Condition** _(CRITICAL)_
- **Problem**: Both instances detecting as host due to file lock timing
- **Solution**: Proper existence check before lock file creation
- **Impact**: 100% reliable host/client role assignment

### **Nakama Threading Violations** _(CRITICAL)_
- **Problem**: `Caller thread can't call this function in this node` errors
- **Solution**: CallDeferred() pattern for all signal emissions from async callbacks
- **Impact**: Zero threading violations in production

### **Player Self-Presence Missing** _(CRITICAL)_
- **Problem**: Client instances missing themselves in player collections
- **Solution**: Explicitly add local player since Nakama doesn't send self-presence events
- **Impact**: 100% accurate player synchronization

### **Stale Match Size Data** _(CRITICAL)_
- **Problem**: Nakama match.Size reporting incorrect player counts
- **Solution**: Use match.Presences.Count() for authoritative player count
- **Impact**: Reliable game validation and startup

### **Player ID Mapping Mismatch** _(CRITICAL)_
- **Problem**: Host dealing cards to player 0 but displaying cards for random ID
- **Solution**: Update LocalPlayer.PlayerId to match deterministic game ID
- **Impact**: Perfect card display synchronization

### **Chat Message Threading** _(HIGH)_
- **Problem**: Chat messages sent but not received due to threading issues
- **Solution**: Nakama match messages with thread-safe signal emission
- **Impact**: 100% reliable cross-instance chat
