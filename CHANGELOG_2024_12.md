# SoreLosers - Changelog December 2024

## üöÄ Major Update: Concurrent Gameplay System Implementation
**Session Focus**: Revolutionary Game Design Change - Simultaneous Card Game + Real-time Movement

### Overview
Implemented a **fundamental shift** from sequential phases (Card ‚Üí Real-time ‚Üí Repeat) to **concurrent gameplay** where card game and real-time sabotage happen simultaneously. This represents the biggest architectural change since project inception.

## üîß Technical Architecture Changes

### Game Phase Evolution
**Old System**: Sequential phases with hard transitions
```
MainMenu ‚Üí Lobby ‚Üí CardPhase ‚Üí RealTimePhase ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Repeat
```

**New System**: Concurrent gameplay with location-based interactions
```
MainMenu ‚Üí Lobby ‚Üí CardPhase (with concurrent movement)
                     ‚Üë
              Location System
              ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AtTable: Card interactions
              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ InKitchen: Movement + Sabotage
```

### Data Flow Enhancements
- **Location State**: Centrally managed by GameManager

**Session Focus**: Networking Fixes & Game Synchronization

## Overview
This session addressed critical multiplayer networking issues and implemented proper game state synchronization between host and client instances. The game is now functional for basic multiplayer card game testing.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. ENet Host Creation Error Resolution
**Problem**: `Couldn't create an ENet host. Parameter "host" is null.`
**Root Cause**: Improper ENet multiplayer peer initialization timing
**Files Changed**: 
- `scripts/NetworkManager.cs`
- `scripts/GameManager.cs`

**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced ENet initialization with proper error handling in `StartHosting()`
- Added try-catch blocks around server creation with detailed logging
- Simplified server creation parameters: `peer.CreateServer(port, MaxClients, 0, 0, 0)`
- Removed problematic async/await pattern that was causing timing issues
- Added fresh peer creation for each port attempt to avoid state corruption

### 2. Auto-Hosting Bypass Fix  
**Problem**: Both instances automatically became hosts, bypassing main menu UI
**Root Cause**: Debug networking setup running automatically in `_Ready()`
**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/GameManager.cs`

**Changes Made**:
- Removed automatic `SetupDebugNetworking()` call from `_Ready()`
- Users now manually control host/join through UI buttons
- Both instances start properly at main menu
- Added comments explaining the change to prevent regression

### 3. Timer Synchronization Implementation
**Problem**: Turn timers didn't match between host and client instances
**Root Cause**: Only host was running timer, clients had no sync mechanism
**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/CardManager.cs`
- `scripts/CardGameUI.cs`

**Changes Made**:
- Added `TurnTimerUpdated` signal to CardManager
- Implemented `NetworkTimerUpdate` RPC method for host‚Üíclient timer sync
- Added `_Process()` method in CardManager to broadcast timer updates every frame
- Modified `GetGameState()` to return synchronized timer for clients
- Connected timer update signal in CardGameUI for real-time display
- Added `networkTurnTimeRemaining` field for client-side timer tracking

### 4. Game Visibility Enhancement
**Problem**: Players could only see their own cards, no visibility into game state
**Root Cause**: UI only displayed local player's hand, no shared game information
**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/CardGameUI.cs`

**Changes Made**:
- Added `playersInfoContainer` and `playerInfoLabels` UI elements
- Implemented `CreatePlayersInfoPanel()` to show all players' status
- Added `UpdatePlayersInfo()` to display card counts, scores, and turn indicators
- Implemented `UpdateTrickDisplay()` to show cards played in current trick
- Enhanced `_Process()` to update trick and player info continuously
- Added visual turn indicators (yellow highlighting for current player)

### 5. Player Management Improvements
**Problem**: "Player ID already exists" errors and duplicate player handling
**Root Cause**: Player ID assignment conflicts and poor error messaging
**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/GameManager.cs`
- `scripts/NetworkManager.cs`

**Changes Made**:
- Modified `AddPlayer()` to only emit `PlayerJoined` signal for new players
- Changed error level from `PrintErr` to `Print` for duplicate player updates
- Added safety checks in NetworkManager for player ID updates
- Only re-add players when network ID actually changes
- Enhanced logging to show when player IDs are updated vs. when they're unchanged

---

## üÜï New Features Added

### Network Timer Synchronization
- **Host-Authoritative Timing**: Only host controls actual game timer
- **Real-time Sync**: Timer updates broadcast to clients every frame via RPC
- **Consistent Display**: Both instances show identical countdown timers
- **Network-Aware Display**: Clients use synchronized time, host uses local timer

### Enhanced Game Visibility
- **Players Info Panel**: Right-side panel showing all player status
  - Player names
  - Cards remaining in hand  
  - Current scores
  - Turn indicators (yellow highlight)
- **Current Trick Display**: Center area showing cards played by all players
- **Real-time Updates**: All displays update immediately when game state changes
