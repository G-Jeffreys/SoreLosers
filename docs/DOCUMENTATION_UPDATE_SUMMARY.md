## Documentation Architecture Changes

### Before: Sequential Phase Documentation
- Card Phase → Real-time Phase → Results
- Separate system documentation for each phase
- Limited integration testing scenarios

### After: Concurrent System Documentation
- Simultaneous card game + movement documentation
- Location-based interaction documentation
- Comprehensive concurrent testing scenarios
- Dual-view UI system documentation

---

## Key Documentation Principles Applied

### 1. Comprehensive Coverage
- Every new feature documented in multiple contexts
- User-facing (PRD) and technical (implementation) perspectives
- Complete testing coverage for all scenarios

### 2. Cross-Reference Consistency
- Location system documented across all relevant files
- Consistent terminology and concepts
- Linked examples and integration patterns

### 3. Future-Proof Documentation
- Extensible architecture documented for future enhancements
- Clear separation of concerns for modular development
- Migration path from old to new system documented

### 4. Practical Testing Focus
- Actionable test cases with specific steps
- Multiple testing levels (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Both automated and manual testing approaches
