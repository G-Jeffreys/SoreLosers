# Nakama Integration: Technical Lessons Learned

**Date**: January 19, 2025  
**Context**: Debugging session for multiplayer card game synchronization  
**Technology Stack**: Nakama + Godot 4.4 + C#  

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document captures critical technical insights from a comprehensive debugging session that successfully resolved multiplayer synchronization issues in a Nakama-based card game. The session revealed several Nakama-specific behaviors and Godot integration challenges that are not well-documented elsewhere.

---

## 🔍 Critical Nakama Behaviors Discovered

### **1. Self-Presence Events Are NOT Sent**
**Discovery**: Nakama does not send presence join events for your own connection.

```csharp
// ❌ This will NOT trigger for the connecting player
Socket.ReceivedMatchPresence += OnMatchPresenceReceived;

// ✅ Must explicitly add self to player collection
if (!Players.ContainsKey(Session.UserId)) {
    AddOrUpdatePlayer(Session.UserId, Session.Username);
}
```

**Impact**: Client instances appeared to have missing players because they never saw themselves join.

**Solution**: Always explicitly add the local player to your player collection in `SetCurrentMatch()`.

---

### **2. match.Size Can Be Stale**
**Discovery**: `IMatch.Size` property can report outdated player counts during rapid join operations.

```csharp
// ❌ Unreliable during rapid state changes
int playerCount = currentMatch.Size;

// ✅ Use presences count for real-time accuracy  
int playerCount = currentMatch.Presences.Count();
```

**Impact**: Game validation logic failed because authoritative match size was incorrect.

**Solution**: Always use `match.Presences.Count()` for current player count validation.

---

### **3. Async Signal Emission Threading Issues**
**Discovery**: Nakama socket events execute on background threads, causing Godot signal emission violations.

```csharp
// ❌ Causes threading errors
private void OnMatchStateReceived(IMatchState matchState) {
    EmitSignal(SignalName.GameStarted); // Thread violation!
}

// ✅ Thread-safe pattern
private void OnMatchStateReceived(IMatchState matchState) {
    CallDeferred(MethodName.EmitGameStartedSignal);
}

private void EmitGameStartedSignal() {
    EmitSignal(SignalName.GameStarted);
}
```

**Impact**: `Caller thread can't call this function in this node` errors throughout the system.

**Solution**: ALWAYS use `CallDeferred()` for signal emissions from Nakama callbacks.

---

## 🏗️ Godot-Specific Integration Patterns

### **File-Based Instance Detection**
**Challenge**: Determining host/client roles when running multiple Godot instances.

```csharp
// ✅ Reliable instance detection pattern
var lockFilePath = OS.GetUserDataDir() + "/instance.lock";

if (File.Exists(lockFilePath)) {
    // This is NOT the first instance (client)
    isFirstInstance = false;
} else {
    // This IS the first instance (host)
    using var fileStream = File.Create(lockFilePath);
    isFirstInstance = true;
}
```

**Key Insight**: Check existence BEFORE creating the lock file to avoid race conditions.

---

### **Player ID Synchronization**
**Challenge**: Matching game logic player IDs with UI display IDs across instances.

```csharp
// ✅ Deterministic ID assignment
var sortedPlayers = Players.Values.OrderBy(p => p.UserId);
int playerId = playerIndex * 2; // Even numbers: 0, 2, 4, 6

// ✅ Update LocalPlayer ID for card display sync
if (gameManager?.LocalPlayer != null) {
    gameManager.LocalPlayer.PlayerId = playerId;
}
```

**Key Insight**: Use deterministic sorting and update local references to match game IDs.

---

## 🌐 Network Architecture Insights

### **Hybrid Networking Approach**
**Discovery**: Successfully combined Nakama match messaging with traditional Godot RPC for different purposes.

```
Nakama Match Messages:
├── Player Ready Status
├── Game Start/End
├── Chat Messages
└── Critical Game State

Traditional RPC:
├── Real-time Movement
├── Visual Effects
└── Local Interactions
```

**Key Insight**: Use Nakama for authoritative state, traditional RPC for real-time feedback.

---

### **Message Threading Pattern**
**Best Practice**: Standardized pattern for all Nakama message handling.

```csharp
// Template for all message handlers
private void HandleAnyMessage(string data) {
    try {
        var message = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<MessageType>(data);
        // Process data synchronously
        
        // Always use CallDeferred for UI updates
        CallDeferred(MethodName.UpdateUIMethod, processedData);
    }
    catch (Exception ex) {
        GD.PrintErr($"Error handling message: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

---

## 🔧 Debugging Techniques That Worked

### **1. Comprehensive State Logging**
```csharp
// Log everything for debugging
GD.Print($"Players.Count: {Players.Count}");
GD.Print($"Match.Size: {match.Size}");  
GD.Print($"Presences.Count: {match.Presences.Count()}");

foreach (var player in Players) {
    GD.Print($"  - {player.Value.Username} (Ready: {player.Value.IsReady})");
}
```

### **2. Authoritative vs Local State Comparison**
```csharp
// Compare multiple data sources
var localCount = Players.Count;
var nakamaSize = currentMatch.Size;
var presenceCount = currentMatch.Presences.Count();

GD.Print($"Local: {localCount}, Nakama: {nakamaSize}, Presences: {presenceCount}");
```

### **3. Retry Mechanisms with Limits**
```csharp
// Prevent infinite loops while allowing recovery
if (retryCount < MAX_RETRIES) {
    retryCount++;
    CallDeferred(MethodName.RetryOperation);
} else {
    GD.PrintErr("FATAL: Max retries exceeded");
}
```

## 📊 Performance Lessons

### **Player Collection Management**
- Clear collections on match change to prevent stale data
- Use deterministic sorting for consistent ordering across instances
- Cache frequently accessed player data locally

### **Network Message Optimization**
- Batch multiple state changes into single messages
- Use enums for message types (smaller payload)
- Validate data locally before sending to reduce network calls

---

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### **1. Assuming Self-Presence Events**
❌ Don't assume you'll receive presence events for your own connection.

### **2. Trusting match.Size**
❌ Don't use `match.Size` for real-time player count validation.

### **3. Direct Signal Emission from Async**
❌ Never emit Godot signals directly from Nakama callback threads.

### **4. Race Conditions in Instance Detection**
❌ Don't create lock files without checking existence first.

### **5. Hardcoded Player IDs**
❌ Don't rely on random player IDs for cross-instance synchronization.
